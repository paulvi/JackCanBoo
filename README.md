# Jack Can Boo
a story for my son

## Ch 1

Once upon a time there was young warrior named Jack.

- Congratulation, Jack. - Said nice fairy. - You come here for a great job, you way to becoming knight is predestinated. Here is TinCan model RM, it is very wise and it will guide you through your journey.

## Ch 2

- Hello Jack, - said horseman. - I have heard about your achievements. Would you help me in fight against Dragon that is tacking over mountain kindgdom?
TinCan was flashing all lights, signalling it is all good.

## Ch 3 Meeting Black Knight

There is only one man in the world who knows where the Dragon is and that is Black Knight.

Black Night was not impressed by introduction of Jack. There was no talking of how to track Dragon. He is so busy to explain his mastership to peasants. So everybody just got on waiting for Black Night to lead the way, sharpening their axes and swords. It is going to be great hunt.

## Ch 4 Boo

The croud passed many valleys going up into mountains and down into marshes. Every day was exhausting.

One day Jack saw old horseman. 

- Who is that? - He asked his comrades
- That is Boo 
 
Jack asked too talk with Boo. 
- You asked me to fight against Dragon, but we dragged by Black Knight in many places and there are any traces of Dragon. We need help to guide in this land.
- You very clever yong man. If my duty to the King leaves me a free day, I would join your hunt.
